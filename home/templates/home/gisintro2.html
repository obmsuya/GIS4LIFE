  <h1>Key Terms</h1>
  <p><h2>Attribute query</h2>
     <p>Request for features based on values in the attribute table. The three basic components of an attribute query are the attribute field, operator,
     and attribute value.
     </p>
     <h2>Feature</h2>
        <p>A representation of a real-world object on a GIS map.</p>
        
        <h2>Geographical Coordinates</h2>
        <p>A measurement of a location on the earth's surface expressed in degrees of latitude and longitude.</p>
        
        <h2>GIS</h2>
        <p>Acronym for geographic information system. An integrated system of data, software, hardware, people and workflows used to answer questions, make
        decisions,and provide tools to create, share, and use geographic information.</p>
        
        <h2>Layers</h2>
        <p>References GIS data that represents real world features. The layer creates a symbol to represent the collection of these features. The features in
        a layer have the same theme, geometry, and set of attributes.</p>
        
        <h2>Local Query</h2>
        <p>Request for features based on the location and spatial relationship to other features. The three basic components of a location query are the layer
        containing features to select, the location relationship, and the layer containing the related features.</p>
        
        <h2>Metadata</h2>
        <p>Information that describes the content, quality, condition, origin, and other characteristics of data.</p> 
        
        <h2>Raster</h2>
        <p>A data model that defines surfaces as an array of equally sized cells arranged in rows and columns. Each cell contains an attribute or measurement
        value. A raster's origin, cell size, and relative cell location are used to determine the location of the cells and raster on the earth.</p>
        
        <h2>Scale</h2>
        <p>Relationship between the size of a feature on a map and the actual size of that feature in the real world. Scales can be expressed as a ratio or
        an equivalence.</p>
        
        <h2>Vector</h2>
        <p>A data model that represents geographic features as points, polylines, and polygons. Attributes are associated with each vector feature, as
        opposed to a raster data model, which associates attributes with grid cells. Vector data uses pairs of geographic coordinates to determine the
        location of the features on the earth.</p><br>

  <h1>What can you do with GIS</h1>
<p>As previously discussed, a GIS uses geographic information to help users answer questions and make decisions. One of the most common GIS
formats is a map. Shown here are real-world examples of GIS maps that have been formatted to analyze trends, find relationships, and assist with
future decisions.</p>  <br>               
        
<h4><span>Map location</span></h4>
<p>We can map the spatial location of real-world features and visualize the spatial relationships among them.  Example one:
The map below illustrates the location of countries, rivers, and cities within the continent of Africa. Locational maps can be used to determine where
things are situated in relation to each other and are often used with navigation.
Map quantities. People map quantities, such as where the most and least are, to find places that meet their criteria or to see the
relationships between places. 
Example: below is a map of cemetery locations in Wisconsin.  The map shows the cemetery locations as dots (dot density) and each
county is color coded to show where the most and least are (lighter blue means fewer cemeteries).</p>

<br><br>

<h4><span>Map what is inside</span></h4>
We can use GIS to determine what is happening or what features are located inside a specific area/region. We can determine the characteristics of "inside"
by creating specific criteria to define an area of interest (AOI).<br>
This map illustrates school locations in relation to crime areas. Mapping what is inside can assist with monitoring and assessment. According to this map, schools
located in Miami may be more at risk, because Miami has the highest number of crime reports.
<br>
<img src="{%static 'img/intro3.jpg'%}"   class= 'img-responsive'>

   <br><br>
   
 <h4><span> Map densities</span></h4> 
  
  <p>Sometimes it is more important to map concentrations, or a quantity normalized by area or total number.
This map illustrates a higher population density in the southeast portion of Canada. Density maps can be used to condense large amounts of data
analyzed for correlations and trends. Further analysis could be completed to determine if the denser population is related to the proximity of the
border or the proximity of water bodies.</p><br>

  <img src="{%static 'img/intro4.jpg'%}"   class= 'img-responsive'>
  
  
  <br><br>
  
  
  <h4><span> What is nearby.</span></h4>
  <p>We can find out what is happening within a set distance of a feature or event by mapping what is nearby using geoprocessing tools like BUFFER</p>
  <br>
   <img src="{%static 'img/intro5.jpg'%}"   class= 'img-responsive'>
      
  <br>
  <p>This map illustrates the proximity of JMill retail stores to county spending potential. Mapping what is nearby is often used in risk
  assessment and predictions. JMill predicts higher revenue in the Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island stores, because they are located
  within 20 miles of a higher potential spending index.</p>
  <br><br>
  
<h4><span>Map change</span></h4> 
   <p>We can map the change in a specific geographic area to anticipate future conditions, decide on a course of action, or to evaluate the results
   of an action or policy. The map below illustrates population change over the past 10 years. The largest population changes occurred in the
   western and southeastern states. This can be used to assess future trends in urban sprawl and market demands.

<h1>How GIS works</h1>
<p>Whether you search a location on the Internet or map car routes, you can use a GIS to get the information you need.

GIS provides tools to find, use, create, and share geographic information with others. For example, you can locate location for each
of your customers, share this information with your coworkers, and work together to build a customer profile. The functionality and
versatility of a GIS depends on the system itself. A GIS integrates hardware, software, data, people, and workflows
into its comprehensive package.</p>

<h3>Data</h3>
<p>Data has spatial and attribute information to explain where something is and
what something is.</p>


<h3>Software</h3>
<p>Software is to store, analyze, and display geographical data.</p>

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Data and software run off hardware, which can range from centralized computer servers to desktops to handheld devices
. Geographic Information can be created, shared, and used from each of these hardware devices.</p>

<h3>People</h3>
<p>People use GIS sotware to perform GIS task on geographic data. People create and follow workflow to
order GIS tast and make their work more efficient.</p>

  <h2 class="display-3"><span>Latitude?</span></h2>
  
          <p>Latitude is defined as a measurement of distance in degrees north and south of the equator. The word latitude is derived from the latin word, "latus", mearning "wide"</p>
            
         <img src="{%static 'img/lat1.jpg'%}"   class= 'img-responsive'>


         <p>There are 90 degrees of latitude from the equator to each of the poles, north and south. Latitude lines are parallel, that is they are the same distance apart.
         These lines are sometimes refered to as parallels.</p>

         <h3 class="display-3"><span>The equator</span></h3>
         
        <p>The equator is the longest of all lines of latitude. It divides the earth in alf and is measured as 0 (Zero degrees)</p>

         <h3 class="display-3"><span>North and South Latitudes</span></h3>
        
       Positions on latitude lines above the equator are called "north" and are in the northern hemisphere.  Positions on latitude lines below the equator are
       called "south" and are in the southern hemisphere.

         </div>
         <p>Longitude is defined as measurement of distance in degrees east or west of the prime meridian.
         The word longitude is derived from the Latin word, "longus", meaning "length"</p>.
          <img src="{%static 'img/lat6.jpg'%}"   class= 'img-responsive'>
            
        <p>The Prime Meridian, as do all other lines of longitude, pass through the north and south pole. They make the earth look like a peeled orange.</p>

      <p>There are 180 lines of longitude on each side of the prime meridian.  But on the opposite side, the primer meridian is not
      zero degrees but 180 degree.  It is called the International Date Line.</p>

        <p>To fine your exact location on a map, you need to determine which latitude line and which longitude line meet where you are standing.
      When writing locations, the latitude is given first.
      For example <br>
      Miami, Florida, has a location of 25 degree North and 80 degree West.<br>
      This is usually written in a short form as 25 degree N 80 degree W </p>
